#mac-moo#

Yeah, that's not one huge program that makes miracles...
but I was used to develop on linux and since I moved to OS X 
I miss my moos =P

It's just:

		$ git clone git://github.com:tadeuzagallo/mac-moo
		$ cd mac-moo
		$ ./install.sh

		$ mac-moo
		         (__)
		         (oo)
		   /------\/
		  / | ||
		 * /\---/
		    ~~ ~~ 
		...."Have you mooed today?"....
